## [PROBLEM 1 - Alphabet Soup Problem] <br>
<h3>Description and thought process - to be added</h3><br>
The Alphabet Soup program is a program that lets the user input any string, and the program will sort the input <br>
in alphabetical order. <br> <br>

To solve this problem, we have to use the function ".isalpha()" because it checks if the character in the string is  <br>
part of the alphabet or not. It will only include all the alphabet characters in the string before proceeding with <br>
the program. This must be done for every character in the string thus, I put it in a for loop. Next is to sort the <br>
alphabet characters in alphabetical order, thus using the "sorted()" function. However, using this function alone <br>
will result in a listed output, hence we use the ".join()" function, which connects all the elements in the list <br>
together in one single string. Finally, we need to display the output using the "print" function <br><br>

### [ADDITIONAL CODES] <br><br>

To ensure that the sorting process and its output go as smoothly and as cleanly as possible, I've added a few lines <br>
of commands in the code. Starting with the ".lower()" command, which turns all the string values to lowercases if <br>
if possible. This is because of the nature of capitalized and lowercase letters having different values hence, <br>
disrupting the flow of the sorting of the string. <br>

Next is the ".strip()" command, which removes all the white spaces from the left and the right of the program <br>
